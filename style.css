/* for the style of my webpage, i liked the idea of a more montone/monochromatic
colour palette. being a rabbit, i settled on shades of green, grey and dark brown (though i chose to use slightly different
colours for the secondary webpages to show variety). I chose typewriter-type fonts because I like it, and because I thought that
because Bugs Bunny was born in the 1940's - he would be familiar with typewriter fonts...
no other justifiable reason, lol. I decided on a mixture of bolded fonts, darker/lighter colours
and lists to establish a hierarchy to the viewer/user to lead their eye around the webpage. 

I decided to throw as much variability into my css as possible to practice and learn different
styles and ways of doing things, and i also used lots of classes, https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.php, 
as it seems to be a very popular way to write CSS from what I found
while researching for this project. I did find the CSS portion the most difficult by far, and probably spent
the most amount of time formatting the webpage to look the way it does. The youtube channel "BroCode" aided in a lot of 
what I implemented throughout my CSS which will be specifically mentioned throughout. 

i also watched this tutotial, as mentioned in my HTML code,
to get a better idea of CSS styles and how much variation you have when designing how
your webpage looks. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHb9JobDs2o&ab_channel=WEBCIFAR */

I also used my beloved W3 schools with the following links:
border radius - https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_border-radius.php - border radius i thought would round 
corners, can't tell if they are rounded or not..?
padding- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp, creates space around an element
and it's content... this was a lot of trial and error for me because it's hard for me to
think in px - i used padding in different directions (left, top, etc).
