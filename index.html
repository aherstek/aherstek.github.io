<!-- when planning this website, the two words that came to mind where sleek and cohesive. I wanted
my webpage to be easy for the viewer/user to follow and appealing to look at. I watched many Youtube
videos (I'm a visual learner) about how to set up HTML webpages specicially for resumes, which I 
believe gave me a good grasp on how to write and format my code (along with the holy W3 schools
resource) i will link and reference the video tutorials i used throughout my code, 
where they gave me direct inspiration. 

i wanted to challenge myself with this website as 1) i want to increase my grade in this class but more
importantly, i believe this is such a valueble skill to learn and something i am finding more and more
interest in as i progress in this class. anyways, i feel like i'm rambling lol here's my code! :) -->

	<!--Titling my HTML code, and referencing/linking my CSS style to this website. overall,
	    i watched tutorials like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHb9JobDs2o&ab_channel=WEBCIFAR 
	    as this tutorial gave me a great generalized idea of "flow" for how I 
	    wanted to write my code (for CSS and HTML), as well as how many
	    possibilities there are in ways to style the sections of the resume and make it your own!-->
