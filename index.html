<!-- when planning this website, the two words that came to mind where sleek and cohesive. I wanted
my webpage to be easy for the viewer/user to follow and appealing to look at. I watched many Youtube
videos (I'm a visual learner) about how to set up HTML webpages specicially for resumes, which I 
believe gave me a good grasp on how to write and format my code (along with the holy W3 schools
resource) i will link and reference the video tutorials i used throughout my code, 
where they gave me direct inspiration. 

i wanted to challenge myself with this website as 1) i want to increase my grade in this class but more
importantly, i believe this is such a valueble skill to learn and something i am finding more and more
interest in as i progress in this class. i opted to use a lot of <div>'s for my block elements, as it was the
easiest way i could try and get the results i wanted. i had intitally had blocks like main, header, footer, article
etc but was having trouble making the columned look that i liked that i have on my own resume. through research,
i decided to try out div and it made the most sense to me... i know people argue about the use of them which i also
understand, but to me this is the way i figured out to accomplish the results i wanted. Some opinions I read about here 
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-web-developers-always-use-many-div-in-the-HTML explain pros and cons to using/not using them.

^ this website gives a great flow chart on why to use <div> last, but for some reason i couldn't wrap my head around using them when trying to
make what i wanted to.... but am excited to rip this weboage apart after we're done with it to try other ways without heavily using <div> 
	
more videos i watched that gave me some general inspriation and insight on how to map out my webpage:

	    i watched tutorials like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHb9JobDs2o&ab_channel=WEBCIFAR

	    wanted to write my code (for CSS and HTML), as well as how many
	    possibilities there are in ways to style the sections of the resume and make it your own using div's!-->
